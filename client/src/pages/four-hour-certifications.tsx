    body: `Cryptography: Secrets, Locks, and Digital Trust is a rigorous but accessible four-hour web course taught, tutored, drilled, and graded by AI. It turns codes, ciphers, and digital trust into a structured learning experience with concrete cases, adaptive practice, grounded tutoring, and built-in academic-integrity screening.

The course explains how machines keep secrets, the idea that made the internet possible, and why real-world cryptographic systems usually fail at the human and implementation layers rather than in the mathematics itself.`,
  },
  {
    emoji: "🧭",
    title: "The Four-Hour Learning Journey",
    body: `**Hour 1 — Every Code Ever Broken Was Broken Because People Repeat Themselves** -- Letter counts, stock phrases, weather reports, and the habits that made systems such as Enigma vulnerable. The hour also distinguishes decipherment from cryptanalysis through the recovery of Linear B.

**Hour 2 — Perfect Secrecy Exists, Is Provable, and Is Worthless** -- Why an unbreakable cipher went largely unused, and why practical security is priced rather than guaranteed.

**Hour 3 — Two Strangers Can Agree on a Secret While Everyone Listens** -- The central insight behind public-key cryptography and secure communication over the internet.

**Hour 4 — Nobody Breaks the Math; Things Fall Apart at the Seams** -- Keys, people, weak randomness, leaky clocks, sloppy code, and governments: where real-world failures occur.`,

    title: "Learning and Assessment",
    body: `**Three Lecture Depths** -- Every lecture is available at Short, Medium, or Long depth while preserving the same examples and learning objectives.

**Grounded AI Tutor** -- The section-scoped tutor streams answers grounded in the exact lecture passage on screen.

**Adaptive Practice** -- Generated scenario problems adjust difficulty according to recent answers and preserve difficulty across the session.

**Reasoned Application** -- Coursework combines multiple-choice questions with concise freeform responses that apply cryptographic ideas to concrete cases rather than merely reciting definitions.

**Four Graded Checkpoints** -- Two homework sets, a timed course test, and a cumulative final provide immediate percentage grades and feedback.

**Reasoning Primers and Diagnostics** -- Ungraded cryptography and general-reasoning instruments are available across multiple formats, lengths, and course phases.

**Academic Integrity** -- Every submission is checked by static text detection and diachronic keystroke-pattern analysis.`,

  {
    emoji: "👥",
    title: "Designed For",
    body: `**Researchers and Professionals** -- A foundational but substantial introduction to cryptography compressed into a focused four-hour experience.

**Product and Engineering Teams** -- A shared language for codes, ciphers, digital trust, and the failure modes surrounding secure systems.

**Instructors and Curriculum Designers** -- A working example of AI-taught and AI-graded coursework with integrity controls.

**Academic-Integrity Researchers** -- A live demonstration of layered authorship screening in an educational product.`,

Its adaptive-practice engine preserves and adjusts per-session difficulty. GPTZero-backed text detection is blended with structural signals, while keystroke analysis evaluates paste-and-rewrite behavior and sustained input patterns.

Operator diagnostics verify the database, course seed, model completion, JSON mode, detection, practice, grading, analytics, and answer-persistence evidence. A content marker detects subject changes and transactionally replaces stale curriculum.`,

    title: "The Learning Journey",

**Adaptation and Evolutionary Inference** -- Adaptations, by-products, noise, hypothesis formation, alternatives, and standards of evidence.

**Sexual Selection and Mating** -- Mate preferences, competition, trade-offs, and variation across people and contexts.

**Parental Investment and Families** -- Investment, parent–offspring conflict, life-history trade-offs, and caregiving ecology.

**Kin Selection and Inclusive Fitness** -- Relatedness, indirect fitness, kin recognition, and conditional helping.

**Cooperation and Reciprocity** -- Reciprocal altruism, partner choice, punishment, reputation, and collective action.

**Social Cognition, Status, and Groups** -- Coalitions, hierarchy, social learning, conflict, and intergroup psychology.
